# Task 4 - Analysis

## Carolina

**Research question:** Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

**Hypothesis:**
    I predict that employees are less willing to discuss mental health in the workplace as the number of employees in a company increases. This is because the relations between coworkers, and workers and supervisors are more distant amd superficial in big companies.

### Analysis plan

1.Compare mental health consequence variable with the number of employees along with supervisor variable.

Goal: observe the employees' expectations across companies (with different sizes) when discussing a mental health issue with employers, and if the fear of a negative consequence impact their willingness to talk about mental health with supervisors.

2.Compare supervisor variable with the number of employees along with coworkers variable.
  
Goal: observe if employees are more open to talk about mental health with coworkers than with supervisors, and how this openess change across companies with different number of employees.

### 1. Number of employees vs. Mental health consequence vs. Supervisor

- Out of 292 "Yes" entries, 81 (27.7%) came from workers of tech companies that have more than 1000 employees. 
- 13% were from workers in companies with 1-5 employees, 18.8% 6-25 employees, 22.6% were 26-100 employees, 13.4% 100-500 employees, 4.5% 500-1000 employees, and 27.7% in companies with more than 1000 employees.
- Concrete conclusions cannot be drawn solely from this plot as the sample size differ across companies sizes.

If small companies have less than 100 employees and big companies have more than 100, the data demostrates that employees from small tech companies are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences than employees from big tech companies. Alhtough "Maybe" is not equivalent to "Yes", both answers points to similar conclusions, which the responder would not be open to talk about a mental health issue with employer since they believe (certainly or not) that it could have negative consequences.

When comparing with the question: "Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor?", it is conclusive that people that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors. On the other hand, people that think that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences are more likely to be willing to discuss a mental health issue with some direct supervisors.

### 2. Number of employees vs. Supervisor vs. Coworkers

Looking at the count of the supervisor column, the number of employees that are willing to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor is higher in organizations with less than 500 employees. On the other hand, the number of "No" answers outstand "Yes" and "Some of them" in companies with more than 500 employees. Even though "Yes" and "Some of them" are segregated in the plot, logically, they can both be interpreted as employees being open to discuss mental health. However, the plot shows that small companies have a significant higher "Yes" frequency than "Some of them". This may suggest that all the relationships in small organizations are more intimal or open as employees are willing to talk about mental health with any supervisor.


When comparing the supervisor variable with the coworker variable, it is observed that employees that are open to have a discussion with any direct supervisor are also open to have a discussion with any or some coworkers. The frequency of people that are willing to talk about mental health with supervisors but not with coworkers is generally low. Nonetheless, the frequency is a little bit higher in big companies. Employees that would not talk about mental health with supervisors would either not talk to any coworker or would talk to some of them for every company size. Overall, the employee likelihood of being open to discuss a mental issue with the direct supervisor and coworkers (the intersection between supervisor and coworker variable) is not interfered by the number of employees.

### Conclusion

**Research question:** Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

- Employees are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences in organizations with less than 100 employees.
- Employees that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors.
- Employees are more whilling to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor in companies with less than 500 employees.
- Employees that are whilling to discuss a mental health issue with any of their direct supervisor are also whilling to have he same discussion with any coworker or some of them.
- Based the openess for mental health discussion on the three variables, the analysis shows a negative correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open wmployees are to discuss mental health. The likelihood of an employee to be open to discuss mental health decreases as the comapny size increases.
