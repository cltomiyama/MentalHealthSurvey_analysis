# Task 4 - Analysis

## Carolina

Research question: Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

Hypothesis:
    I predict that employees are less willing to discuss mental health in the workplace as the number of employees in a company increases. This is because the relations between coworkers, and workers and supervisors are more distant amd superficial in big companies.

### Analysis plan

1.Compare mental health consequence variable with the number of employees along with supervisor variable.

Goal: observe the employees' expectations across companies (with different sizes) when discussing a mental health issue with employers, and if the fear of a negative consequence impact their willingness to talk about mental health with supervisors.

2.Compare supervisor variable with the number of employees along with coworkers variable.
  
Goal: observe if employees are more open to talk about mental health with coworkers than with supervisors, and how this openess change across companies with different number of employees.

### 1. Number of employees vs. Mental health consequence vs. Supervisor

![graph1](graph1.jpg)
Figure 1. Frequency of "Yes" entries to the question "Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have a negative consequence?" across tech organizations with different number of employees. 

- Out of 292 "Yes" entries, 81 (27.7%) came from workers of tech companies that have more than 1000 employees.
- 13% were from workers in companies with 1-5 employees, 18.8% 6-25 employees, 22.6% were 26-100 employees, 13.4% 100-500 employees, 4.5% 500-1000 employees, and 27.7% in companies with more than 1000 employees.
- Concrete conclusions cannot be drawn solely from this plot as the sample size differ across companies sizes.

Figure 2. The employees' expectations when discussing a mental health issue with an employer across tech companies with different number of employees. The trend between the two variable is observed along the employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor. The data was collected from 1259 tech employees' answers to a suvey. There is a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the mental health consequence variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 21.14, p-value= 0.02).

If small companies have less than 100 employees and big companies have more than 100, the data demostrates that employees from small tech companies are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences than employees from big tech companies. Alhtough "Maybe" is not equivalent to "Yes", both answers points to similar conclusions, which the responder would not be open to talk about a mental health issue with employer since they believe (certainly or not) that it could have negative consequences.
​
When comparing with the question: "Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor?", it is conclusive that people that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors. On the other hand, people that think that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences are more likely to be willing to discuss a mental health issue with some direct supervisors.

### 2. Number of employees vs. Supervisor vs. Coworkers

![graph3](graph3.jpg)
Figure 3. The employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor across tech companies with different number of employees. The trend between the two variables is observed along the employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers. The data was collected from 1259 tech employees' answers to a survey. There is a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the supervisor variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 20.60, p-value= 0.02). There is also a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the coworkers variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 28.45, p-value= 0.001)

Looking at the count of the supervisor column, the number of employees that are willing to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor is higher in organizations with less than 500 employees. On the other hand, the number of "No" answers outstand "Yes" and "Some of them" in companies with more than 500 employees. Even though "Yes" and "Some of them" are segregated in the plot, logically, they can both be interpreted as employees being open to discuss mental health. However, the plot shows that small companies have a significant higher "Yes" frequency than "Some of them". This may suggest that all the relationships in small organizations are more intimal or open as employees are willing to talk about mental health with any supervisor.

When comparing the supervisor variable with the coworker variable, it is observed that employees that are open to have a discussion with any direct supervisor are also open to have a discussion with any or some coworkers. The frequency of people that are willing to talk about mental health with supervisors but not with coworkers is generally low. Nonetheless, the frequency is a little bit higher in big companies. Employees that would not talk about mental health with supervisors would either not talk to any coworker or would talk to some of them for every company size. Overall, the employee likelihood of being open to discuss a mental issue with the direct supervisor and coworkers (the intersection between supervisor and coworker variable) is not interfered by the number of employees.

### Conclusion

Research question: Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

- Employees are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences in organizations with less than 100 employees.
- Employees that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors.
- Employees are more whilling to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor in companies with less than 500 employees.
- Employees that are whilling to discuss a mental health issue with any of their direct supervisor are also whilling to have he same discussion with any coworker or some of them. 
- The Chi-Square test showed that there is a significant correlation between the number of employees in a tech company and the three variables utilized to measure employees' openess to discuss mental health (mhc, sup, and co).
- Based the openess for mental health discussion on the three variables, the analysis shows a negative correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health. The likelihood of an employee to be open to discuss mental health decreases as the comapny size increases.

Research question:What does this data tell us are the biggest factors that affects the mental health of employees?

Anaysis:
Grpah1:#The Aanalysis shown above shows that older employees tend to recieve benfits than those younger which could be a reson why older people   may      sometimes be less likely to have work have a mental consequence on them.
Graph2:From hear we can see that most companies tend to have a number of employees that ranges from 0 to 1000. There is a possiblility that by lowering the number of employees, the less chance there would be a mental consequence on employees.
Graph3:This shows that older aged employees are more likely to develop mental issues than younger people. 
Graph4:There seems to be no correlation between wotking remotly and there being a chance of developing mental issues. 
Graph5:Employees with a family histroy of a mental consequence can also develop mental health issue but it is not the case most of the time. 
Graph6:This shows that employees that do take a leave are less likely to develop mental health issues compared to employees that do not take a leave.


Conclusion: Based of from the analysis carried out obove it is fair two say that the biggest factors that affect there being a consequence on an employees mental
                health are, comapnies that have larger number of employees, employee age and family history. This conclusion was made based of from anaysis of relationships between factors that might be affecting and employees health.

### Research questions

1. Is there a relationship between providing more mental health resources and quality of employees' mental health in the tech industry?
2. Is there a relationship between employees' knowledge of the mental health resources available and the quality of mental health?

**Figure 1**

*Comparison of amount of employer-provided mental health resources between those with a mental health condition and those without a mental health condition*

![figure 1](../../images/gale/1_resource_cond.png)

*Note.* Frequencies of insufficient ("Poor") and sufficient ("Good") amounts of employer-provided mental health resources are shown, with a comparison of how these frequencies differ between those with a mental health condition and those without a mental health condition. Categories for amount of mental health resources are shown on the x-axis, and frequencies on the y-axis. Frequencies are relative to each of these two groups.

Generally, employers seem to not provide enough resources for mental health, and this is similar across both respondents with and without a mental health condition. 77.9% of 647 respondents with a mental health condition and 86.2% of 196 respondents without a mental health condition indicated "Poor" resource provision.

**Figure 2**

*Comparison of how often employees' mental health conditions interfere with work, depending on amount of employer-provided mental health resources*

![figure 2](../../images/gale/1_resource_interfere.png)

*Note.* Frequencies of different responses to the question, "If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?" across respondents with sufficient amounts of mental health resources provided ("Good") and respondents with insufficient mental health resources provided ("Poor"). Responses are shown on the x-axis, and frequencies on the y-axis. Frequencies are relative to the groups that are based on whether resource provision is "Good" or "Poor."

Respondents who are provided with sufficient amounts of mental health resources generally feel like their mental health conditions interfere with their work less. This is most obvious looking at the frequency of respondents who feel that their condition "often" interferes with their work. Whereas 6.6% of those with sufficient mental health resources feel that their condition often interferes with their work, 14.2% of those with poorer mental health resources feel this way. 

Frequencies of "Never" and "Rarely" responses are also higher among respondents with sufficient mental health resources. 25.7% of those with sufficient resources indicate their condition "never" interferes with their work, whereas 20.6% of those with insufficient resources indicate the same.

**Figure 3**

*Frequency of seeking treatment for mental health conditions, across those with insufficient mental health resources and those with sufficient mental health resources*

![figure 3](../../images/gale/1_resource_interfere.png)

*Note.* Figure shows frequencies of those who have sought mental health treatment and those who have not. Categories of treatment status are shown on the x-axis, and frequencies on the y-axis. The graph on the left shows frequencies among those with "Good" resource provision, and the graph on the right shows frequencies among those with "Poor" resource provision.

Regardless of whether they have insufficient of sufficient mental health resources, the majority of respondents with a mental health condition have sought treatment. In terms of treatment status, being provided with insufficient or sufficient amounts of mental health resources does not appear to make much of a difference. 63.8% of those with sufficient resource provision 62.8% of those with insufficient resource provision have sought treatment.


**Conclusions**

- Generally, employers in the tech industry do not provide enough mental health resources for their employees.
- Analyses show that being provided with more mental health resources is negatively associated with the frequency of mental health interfering with work. In other words, the more resources that are provided to employees, the less mental health concerns interfere with work.
- Knowledge of what mental health resources are available seems to contribute to the improvement of handling mental health issues. Thus, employers might need to be more intentional about informing employees about the resources available.

Although some relationships were found, the data was limited in providing explanations for the directions of these relationships. For example, the

### Further study

- Responses to how often mental health interferes with work might have been shaped by company's expectations. For further study, it would be insightful to investigate the relationship between mental health interfering with work and workplace expectations and attitudes regarding mental health, and see if there is any mediating effect of mental health resources and/or knowledge of mental health resources.
