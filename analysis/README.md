# Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

## Hypothesis:
I predict that employees are less willing to discuss mental health in the workplace as the number of employees in a company increases. This is because the relations between coworkers, and workers and supervisors are more distant and superficial in big companies.

## Analysis plan

1. Compare the mental health consequence variable with the number of employees along with the supervisor variable.

Goal: observe the employees' expectations across companies (with different sizes) when discussing a mental health issue with employers, and if the fear of a negative consequence impacts their willingness to talk about mental health with supervisors.

2. Compare the supervisor variable with the number of employees along with the coworkers variable.
  
Goal: observe if employees are more open to talking about mental health with coworkers than with supervisors, and how this openess change across companies with different numbers of employees.

## 1. Number of employees vs. Mental health consequence vs. Supervisor

Figure 1. Frequency of "Yes" entries to the question "Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have a negative consequence?" across tech organizations with different numbers of employees. 

- Out of 292 "Yes" entries, 81 (27.7%) came from workers of tech companies that have more than 1000 employees.
- 13% were from workers in companies with 1-5 employees, 18.8% from 6-25 employees, 22.6% from 26-100 employees, 13.4% from 100-500 employees, 4.5% from 500-1000 employees, and 27.7% from companies with more than 1000 employees.
- Concrete conclusions cannot be drawn solely from this plot as the sample size differs across companies' sizes.

Figure 2. The employees' expectations when discussing a mental health issue with an employer across tech companies with different numbers of employees. The trend between the two variables is observed along with the employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor. The data was collected from 1259 tech employees' answers to a survey. There is a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the mental health consequence variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 21.14, p-value= 0.02).

If small companies have less than 100 employees and big companies have more than 100, the data demonstrates that employees from small tech companies are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences than employees from big tech companies. Although "Maybe" is not equivalent to "Yes", both answers point to similar conclusions, which the responder would not be open to talking about a mental health issue with the employer since they believe (certainly or not) that it could have negative consequences.
​
When comparing with the question: "Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor?", it is conclusive that people that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same discussion with direct supervisors. On the other hand, people that think that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences are more likely to be willing to discuss a mental health issue with some direct supervisors.

Figure 3. The employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor across tech companies with different numbers of employees. The trend between the two variables is observed along with the employees' willingness to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers. The data was collected from 1259 tech employees' answers to a survey. There is a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the supervisor variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 20.60, p-value= 0.02). There is also a relevant correlation between the number of employees and the coworkers variable (χ2 contingency test, df= 10, χ2= 28.45, p-value= 0.001)

Looking at the count of the supervisor column, the number of employees that are willing to discuss mental health issues with any direct supervisor is higher in organizations with less than 500 employees. On the other hand, the number of "No" answers outstands "Yes" and "Some of them" in companies with more than 500 employees. Even though "Yes" and "Some of them" are segregated in the plot, logically, they can both be interpreted as employees being open to discussing mental health. However, the plot shows that small companies have a significantly higher "Yes" frequency than "Some of them". This may suggest that all the relationships in small organizations are more intimate or open as employees are willing to talk about mental health with any supervisor.

When comparing the supervisor variable with the coworker variable, it is observed that employees that are open to communicating with any direct supervisor are also open to discussing with any or some coworkers. The frequency of people that are willing to talk about mental health with supervisors but not with coworkers is generally low. Nonetheless, the frequency is a little bit higher in big companies. Employees that would not talk about mental health with supervisors would either not talk to any coworkers or would talk to some of them for every company size. Overall, the employee likelihood of being open to discussing a mental issue with the direct supervisor and coworkers (the intersection between supervisor and coworker variable) is not interfered with by the number of employees.

# Conclusion

Research question: Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discussing mental health?

- Employees are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences in organizations with less than 100 employees.
- Employees that believe that mental health discussions with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same discussion with direct supervisors.
- Employees are more willing to discuss mental health issues with any direct supervisor in companies with less than 500 employees.
- Employees that are willing to discuss a mental health issue with any of their direct supervisors are also willing to have the same discussion with any coworker or some of them. 
- The Chi-Square test showed that there is a significant correlation between the number of employees in a tech company and the three variables utilized to measure employees' openness to discuss mental health (mhc, sup, and co).
- Based on the openness for mental health discussion on the three variables, the analysis shows a negative correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health. The likelihood of an employee being open to discussing mental health decreases as the company size increases.
