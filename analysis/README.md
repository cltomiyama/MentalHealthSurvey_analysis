# Task 4 - Analysis

## Carolina

**Research question:** Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

**Hypothesis:**
    I predict that employees are less willing to discuss mental health in the workplace as the number of employees in a company increases. This is because the relations between coworkers, and workers and supervisors are more distant amd superficial in big companies.

### Analysis plan

1.Compare mental health consequence variable with the number of employees along with supervisor variable.

Goal: observe the employees' expectations across companies (with different sizes) when discussing a mental health issue with employers, and if the fear of a negative consequence impact their willingness to talk about mental health with supervisors.

2.Compare supervisor variable with the number of employees along with coworkers variable.
  
Goal: observe if employees are more open to talk about mental health with coworkers than with supervisors, and how this openess change across companies with different number of employees.

### 1. Number of employees vs. Mental health consequence vs. Supervisor

![graph1](graph1.jpg)

- Out of 292 "Yes" entries, 81 (27.7%) came from workers of tech companies that have more than 1000 employees. 
- 13% were from workers in companies with 1-5 employees, 18.8% 6-25 employees, 22.6% were 26-100 employees, 13.4% 100-500 employees, 4.5% 500-1000 employees, and 27.7% in companies with more than 1000 employees.
- Concrete conclusions cannot be drawn solely from this plot as the sample size differ across companies sizes.

![graph2](graph2.jpg)

If small companies have less than 100 employees and big companies have more than 100, the data demostrates that employees from small tech companies are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences than employees from big tech companies. Alhtough "Maybe" is not equivalent to "Yes", both answers points to similar conclusions, which the responder would not be open to talk about a mental health issue with employer since they believe (certainly or not) that it could have negative consequences.
â€‹

When comparing with the question: "Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor?", it is conclusive that people that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors. On the other hand, people that think that discussing a mental health issue with employers does not have negative consequences are more likely to be willing to discuss a mental health issue with some direct supervisors.

### 2. Number of employees vs. Supervisor vs. Coworkers

![graph3](graph3.jpg)

Looking at the count of the supervisor column, the number of employees that are willing to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor is higher in organizations with less than 500 employees. On the other hand, the number of "No" answers outstand "Yes" and "Some of them" in companies with more than 500 employees. Even though "Yes" and "Some of them" are segregated in the plot, logically, they can both be interpreted as employees being open to discuss mental health. However, the plot shows that small companies have a significant higher "Yes" frequency than "Some of them". This may suggest that all the relationships in small organizations are more intimal or open as employees are willing to talk about mental health with any supervisor.


When comparing the supervisor variable with the coworker variable, it is observed that employees that are open to have a discussion with any direct supervisor are also open to have a discussion with any or some coworkers. The frequency of people that are willing to talk about mental health with supervisors but not with coworkers is generally low. Nonetheless, the frequency is a little bit higher in big companies. Employees that would not talk about mental health with supervisors would either not talk to any coworker or would talk to some of them for every company size. Overall, the employee likelihood of being open to discuss a mental issue with the direct supervisor and coworkers (the intersection between supervisor and coworker variable) is not interfered by the number of employees.

### Conclusion

**Research question:** Is there a correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open employees are to discuss mental health?

- Employees are more confident that discussing a mental health issue with employers do not have negative consequences in organizations with less than 100 employees.
- Employees that believe that mental health discussion with employers can have negative consequences are less likely to be willing to have the same disussion with direct supervisors.
- Employees are more whilling to discuss mental health issue with any direct supervisor in companies with less than 500 employees.
- Employees that are whilling to discuss a mental health issue with any of their direct supervisor are also whilling to have he same discussion with any coworker or some of them.
- Based the openess for mental health discussion on the three variables, the analysis shows a negative correlation between the number of employees in a company and how open wmployees are to discuss mental health. The likelihood of an employee to be open to discuss mental health decreases as the comapny size increases.

**Research question:**What does this data tell us are the biggest factors that affects the mental health of employees?

**Hypothesis:**
    My prediction is that people are more likely to develop mental health issues as they age or especially as they dont go on leave. As people age to they tend to be alble to get more work benfits since they have accumulated more work experience and are therefore more likely will want to confine any issues with mental health as they may not able to disclose it to public. Some people of which recive benefits as well may not be developing mental health problems. 

**Anaysis:** 

### 1. Benefits recieved by employees vs Age of employee.  

Graph1: The Analysis shown above shows that older employees tend to recieve benfits than those younger which could be a reson why older people may sometimes be less likely to have work have a mental consequence on them. The fact that older employees are more likely to recive work benefits compared to other younger employees could help in preventing older employees developing mental health consequences and could be a reason as to why some may be developing mental health issues but refuse to talk about it to people that offer help. There is a dignificant about of elderly employees that although they have recieved benefits that have developed mental health conseqences which may lead to the fact the two factors are not correlated.  

### 2. Number of employees vs Mental health consequences.  

Graph2: From hear we can see that most companies tend to have a number of employees that ranges from 0 to 1000. There is a possiblility that by lowering the number of employees, the less chance there would be a mental consequence on employees, since companies that have a lower number of employees may be able to provide better support to its employees. However this does not not yet sya any thing to as to wheather number of employees has any correlation with employees developing mental health problems or no. 

### 3. Age of employee vs Mental health consequences.  

Graph3: This shows that older aged employees are more likely to develop mental issues than younger people. This may not be particularly due to nay of the factors that have been investigated so far but may be due to the fact that as employees age there ability to coop with stress decress and well as there physical ability of being bale to get severla tasks done on time. Older aged employees as well tend to be wonaitng maore support compared to youmger employees which they dont get bacuase companies are not able to provide them with that tyoe of support.  

### 4. Remotly working vs Mental health consequences. 

Graph4: There seems to be no correlation between wotking remotly and there being a chance of developing mental issues. But interesting the grpah shows that number of employees that do not remotly work and do have mental health issues seem to be much greater than those that remotely work. This may be because those that remotly work get explosed to different work environments all the time and work in much less contrained work invironment compared to those that worked remotely. People that work remotly may have a better chance of being able to choose a certian task of a variatly of tasks compared to those that dont since they are stuck with just doing one task all the time.   

### 5. Familly history vs Mental health consequences. 

Graph5: Employees with a family histroy of a mental consequence can also develop mental health issue but it is not the case most of the time. There is a chance that the employee with a family history of mental health issues will also develope a mental health issue, but those that do not have a family history look too be more than those that do. Therefore it is fair to say that having a family history does not correlate with a likelyness that ane employees would develope mnetal health problems.  

### 6. Leave vs Mental health consequences. 

Graph6: This shows that employees that do take a leave are less likely to develop mental health issues compared to employees that do not take a leave. Based of from the trend shown in the graph it seems that the employyes thta find it relativily easy and have more chances of being able to take a leave are much less likely to develop any metal health problems, propably because they are less overwhelemed with work compared to thoas ethat find taking a leave difficult. This counld tell that a contributing factor employees develop mental health problems is there inability of them being able to keep a balance between there work and there time of work. This could be because they could be more overwhlemed with work form employeers compared to other emplyees.      

### 7. Wellness program vs Mental health consequences. 

Graph7: Emplyees that are in Wellnees programs are far less likely t develop mental health problems compared to employees that are not. This because employees that are in wellness program talk of there problems and seek help in order to get the support that they need in order to support there mental health. The Wellness program does defintly seem to have an effect on employess mental health. Wellness programs should be something that is pressent in all companies. 

**Conclusion:** 

Based of from the analysis carried out obove it is fair two say that the biggest factors that affect there being a consequence on an employees mental
health are, companies that do not allow there employees to work remotly, do not give a chance to employees to go on work and being in a wellness program. Other more note worthy factors that are worth considereing is age and propably number of employees. Although as portrayed earlier in the research that has been carried out having a greater or lower number emplyees reveals an insufficient amount of information of weather an employees is likely to develop mental health problems. Being in a well ness program definely looks to have the most effect on employeees developing mental healh problems since the gets what ever support he needs buy talking about any mental health problems throught the program. Bassed of from this conclusion obtained from this analyais that has been carried out companies should be aware that having well ness programs from employees is essential for there mental health and well being.
