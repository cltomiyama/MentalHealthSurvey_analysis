## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This dataset is from the Open Sourcing Mental Illness organization. It assesses attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders in the tech industry, and considers a wide range of factors, such as age, geography, the nature and size of the company, consequences of discussing mental health in the workplace, and workplace relationships. The data was collected in 2014, with the aim of providing insight into how mental health is approached and addressed in the tech companies in addition to the current state of mental health among individuals in the tech industry. The data was collected through an online survey, with over 1200 respondents. Besides the questions related to self-identification, the survey contained simple yes or no questions like “Are you self-employed?” as long as more complex questions like “How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition?”. In general, we speculate high indices of mental health issues among tech workplaces since it is a fast-growing industry which requires high levels of productivity.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We all understand the importance of mental health, but through this analytics project, we’re hoping to dive deeper into what mental health looks like in a specific industry. Attitudes and protocols regarding mental health might vary between different industries due to the particular nature of their work, so we are curious about the nature of the differences and similarities between how mental health is perceived in our own personal lives versus in the technology industry. The tech industry is known as a fast-growing and intense industry, with more people coming into every day. Thus, it is important to get a clearer picture of the environment regarding employees’ mental health. The dataset presents many variables such as family history, number of employees, and mental health support accessibility which we are interested in comparing and observing correlations. Those contrasts can be visualized in a user-facing Dashboard. Although correlation does not mean causation, the data analysis can lead us to questions that can be further investigated in future research.
