# About the dataset

This dataset is from the Open Sourcing Mental Illness organization. It assesses attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders in the tech industry and considers a wide range of factors, such as age, geography, the nature and size of the company, consequences of discussing mental health in the workplace, and workplace relationships. The data was collected in 2014, with the aim of providing insight into how mental health is approached and addressed in tech companies in addition to the current state of mental health among individuals in the tech industry. The data was collected through an online survey, with over 1200 respondents. Besides the questions related to self-identification, the survey contained simple yes or no questions like “Are you self-employed?” as long as more complex questions like “How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition?”.
